# Komebot

A Discord variety bot started as a personal project. As such, features currently available are more focused on what small communities/groups might want, for convenience in self-created servers.

## Available Commands
### Ping
* Ping Komebot to check for a response.
### Palette
* Display a random color palette (Defaults to a 5-color palette, can be specified manually).
### Roll
* Random number generator (Defaults to a max range of 6).
### Todo
* Basic task list system for personal planning.  

*All commands will also have a brief description when making use of them in a Discord server.
